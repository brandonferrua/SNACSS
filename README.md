# [SNACSS](http://snacss.com)

SNACSS is a boilerplate/bootstrap for rapid protyping of web apps and sites. SNACSS is a customizable (not yet implemented) front-end boilerplate for all you prototyping needs. Change a couple of variables and documentation will do the rest for you! Please bare with us as we are constantly adding and fixing existing bugs to the framework. The framework was built with our needs in mind but would love it to be more than that. 

This project started in colloboration with [Jesse Brack](http://jessebrack.com) with an end goal of making a modular Object Oriented approach to CSS with the power of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com).

## Getting Started

The framework is in a very early state, once we reach a release candidate state, this project will be open sourced. We will provide additional instructions when that day comes.
