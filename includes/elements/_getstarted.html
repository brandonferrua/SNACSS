<h3>File Structure</h3>
<h4>SNACSS Core</h4>
<p>SNACSS is built with an Object Oriented Programatic approach in mind. The File structure consists of partials broken out into their own granular <code>@mixin</code> that can be turned on and off based on your needs and accectable file size. The <a href="">advanced docs</a> will provide more insight into those components. Place the core package within your project, in my project I placed with <code>/assets/snacss/</code>. The package is now available to your project and in the next section, I will go over the basics of initializing the package.</p>

<h4>Initialization</h4>
<p>Now that you have SNACSS available to your project, a few includes will have you up and running in seconds. Within the folder you dropped the SNACSS core, so my example would be <code>/assets/</code>, creating your css folder. This is where all your project level styles will be held. For SNACSS to init, you only need two files but I recommend you keep the OOP approach intact by also creating a <code>/theme/</code> where you will place all your overrides or styles that may not be available within the SNACSS framework. To begin, create two files within <code>/assets/css/</code>, you will need a <code>core.scss</code> and <code>_vars.scss</code>. I'm assuming if you're looking for a SASS framework you will know how to compile a sass file but if you don't, do the following steps: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>open terminal</li>
		<li>dig down to your project, for me its <code>~/username/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/SNACSS/</code></li>
		<li>Run this cmd, <code>sass --watch assets</code></li>
	</ol>
<p>Your project should now be spitting out a <code>core.css</code> file now.</p>
<p>Now lets setup your <code>core.scss</code> file to initialize SNACSS. Below is a basic example of initialization:</p>
<div class="u-code u-code-a">
<pre class="prettyprint">
// Local Project Overrides
@import "vars";

// Import SNACSS Framework
@import "../snacss/settings";
@import "../snacss/init";

// Local Project Styles
@import "theme/core";
</pre>
</div>
