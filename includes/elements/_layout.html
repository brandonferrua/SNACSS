<h4>Layouts</h4>
<p>SNACSS has pre-compiled layouts for your prototyping needs. Below you'll find a handful of pre-defined layouts that should make structuring your sites a breeze. Note, these can be extended upon or you may add your own templates to the SNACSS core. An example to do so is laid out for you below:</p>

<h4>Two Column Layout</h4>
<div class="u-code u-code-a">
	<section role="main col-row">
    	<div class="primary-content col-8">
    		<span class="demo-helper">.primary-content</span>
    	</div>
    	<div class="secondary-content col-4">
    		<span class="demo-helper">.secondary-content</span>
    	</div>
